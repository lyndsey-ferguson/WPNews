The Washington Free Beacon <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/the-hillary-papers/\">reminded us </a>of the beginnings of Clinton and Drudge's long saga this week, by diving into old documents from when he broke the Monica Lewinsky story in 1998. Hillary Clinton's friend, Diane Blair, wrote a note to the first lady back then asking, <a href=\"http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DoWeFearDrudge.pdf\">\"Do we take Matt Drudge seriously?</a>\" During her 2008 run for the White House, she decided to, and reporters and commentators responded in kind. The question now is whether both will take him seriously again in 2016. Below, for posterity, find the long history of writers writing about Drudge writing about Hillary Clinton.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/19/opinion/liberties-hillary-s-house-of-mirth.html\">June 19, 1998</a>, The New York Times:</strong> \"People often wonder how the great social observers of the past would dissect the madness and the inanity in Washington today. How would Mark Twain skewer Kenneth Starr on Larry King? What would be left of Matt Drudge after Evelyn Waugh got through with him? And surely, the ideal chronicler of Hillary Clinton would be Edith Wharton, who sat in her own grand white house writing about women strangled in a cat's cradle of tribal constraints and pieties. She wrote about women forced to narrow their lives or disguise their natures or choke down indignities because of double standards. She wrote about the awful ironies that crushed women's dreams.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Sept. 16, 2000, The Washington Times</strong>: \"The flap began earlier this week when Internet gossip Matt Drudge announced on his Web site -- www.drudgereport.com -- that the New York Times was \"sitting\" on the story of Mrs. Clinton's overnight guests because the newspaper did not want to give ammunition to Mr. Lazio in Wednesday's debate between the two Senate candidates.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/kausfiles_special/2000/09/why_the_clintons_should_love_drudge.html\">Sept. 17, 2000</a>, Slate</strong>: \"Is Matt Drudge good for the Democrats? Not intentionally, of course. But look at who benefits, objectively, as the Marxists say. Last week, Drudge discovered that the New York Times hadn't published a story it had been working on, a story about donors to Hillary Clinton's campaign being rewarded with overnight stays at the White House and Camp David. So Drudge posts an item on his well-read site chiding the Times for sitting on an anti-Clinton report. What happens? The White House goes on full alert, as other news organizations begin to chase the story. The account dribbles out through a variety of outlets, including Fox, a conservative TV network far easier for Clinton supporters to dismiss than the Times would be. When the Times finally prints John Broder's piece about the overnights, it runs in the B section, below the fold, with the headline Mrs. Clinton Denies Visits Rewarded Gifts. The news by this point isn't the overnights, it's whether there was a quid pro quo for them; the first three paragraphs detail the official denial that there was. And the paper has its back up--a prominent paragraph denies Drudge's report that the Times had been suppressing the story. What if Drudge didn't exist (or if he had just done nothing when he learned of the Times piece)?\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://prospect.org/article/virtual-campaign\">Nov. 6, 2000</a>, The American Prospect</strong>: \"Yet with e-spin, it often seems that for every success on the part of a campaign, there's a comparable blunder. In August, Florida Governor Jeb Bush's office was accused of 'bigotry' and of being 'anti-Semitic' after a staffer accidentally e-mailed out a Bible verse to reporters instead of Bush's schedule. (The verse read in part: '[Every] spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist.') And in a more serious slip-up in May, the Hillary Clinton campaign inadvertently sent out the e-mail addresses of hundreds of reporters at the top of an update on the First Lady's travel plans. Matt Drudge got his hands on the list and put a story about it on his Web site; before long, other sites advertised the whole list. Soon, reporters were getting blitzed with hate e-mails from right-wingers lurking in the FreeRepublic.com neighborhood of the Internet. One such message, reported in The Washington Post, read: 'Since Hillary Klinton was nice enough to publish all your e-mail addresses, us in the right wing conspiracy wanted to drop each of you a note to say that you're all slime.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2001/feb/2/20010202-020954-3912r/\">Feb. 2, 2001</a>, The Washington Times</strong>: \"'There's no fingernail polish on the nails. There have been Senate sessions without even any lipstick. It's pushing it to the Janet Reno, Donna Shalala crowd,' opines Internet scribe Matt Drudge, who weighed in on Mrs. Clinton's style crisis in a recent column. 'Even Patty Murray is more glamorous than Hillary,\" giggles Mr. Drudge, on the phone from his Miami newsroom. \"It has Washington completely buzzing out.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://wonkette.com/241675/hillary-attempts-to-join-cast-of-designing-women-two-decades-too-late\">March 5, 2007</a>, Wonkette</strong>: \"This is a conveniently context-free video clip of an audio clip of Hillary Clinton speaking supposedly before a southern Black church. You might notice that she's talkin' funny. Which is all well and good when beloved character actors or presidents do it, but when politicians do it, they're pandering. Or something. Anyway, Matt Drudge said this was important. So listen to it over and over again and start quoting it to your friends at happy hour. Now you're in the gang of 500!\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/media/36617/#print\"><strong>Aug. 24, 2007, New York Magazine</strong></a>: \"But Drudge’s political philosophy is more mysterious than that, given that, currently, the one person Drudge seems to believe can lead is Hillary Clinton. Though Drudge often savages Hillary, he is convinced that she will make history, and he seems determined, in spite of himself, to empower her. HILLARY ON SURGE? “IT’S WORKING” was a recent lead headline. The Clinton scandals of yesteryear bore him, Drudge has said. Right-wing fans have begun to complain about the pattern, calling him “Hillary-obsessed.” What an irony that the gossip who almost destroyed Bill Clinton’s presidency might propel his wife to the Oval Office. “That House is going pink,” says Drudge.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/22/us/politics/22drudge.html?pagewanted=all\">Oct. 2, 2007</a>, The New York Times</strong>: \"Mrs. Clinton’s aides declined to discuss how the Drudge Report got access to her latest fund-raising figures nearly 20 minutes before the official announcement went to supporters. But it was a prime example of a development that has surprised much of the political world: Mrs. Clinton is learning to play nice with the Drudge Report and the powerful, elusive and conservative-leaning man behind it.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/oct/23/usa.hillaryclinton1\">Oct. 22, 2007</a>, The Guardian</strong>: \"Some would argue that Ms Clinton owes her political career to Drudge. In 1998, the humiliation of her husband's affair with the White House intern led to an outpouring of sympathy for the first lady. Her approval ratings soared, the image of the calculating political spouse blurred. The idea of running for the Senate, which Ms Clinton had been pondering, seemed less of a long shot. She launched her campaign early the next year.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://bostonherald.com/news_opinion/us_politics/2007/10/hill_drudge_ingly_accepting_how_play_media_game\">Oct. 23, 2007</a>, The Boston Herald</strong>: \"Hill Drudge-ingly accepting of how to play media game\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/12/teacher-and-apprentice/306442/?single_page=true\">Dec. 1, 2007</a>, The Atlantic</strong>: \"Perhaps the ultimate example of hard-won experience is the relationship that developed last year, brokered by an outside ally, between the Clinton campaign and a man who was once a sworn enemy: Matt Drudge, the Internet pioneer. (News of the Monica Lewinsky scandal first broke on the <i>Drudge Report</i>.) In a Democratic primary, news that the Clinton campaign is funneling information to Drudge is potentially explosive—few figures inspire more liberal wrath than Drudge. (When I confronted the mole, she confirmed the connection to Drudge, but first asked for anonymity.) Still, Drudge has proved a useful tool for the campaign in framing media coverage. When it became clear that Obama had raised more first-quarter money for the primary race than Clinton had, the Clinton campaign minimized the damage by preemptively leaking its own numbers to Drudge. “Clinton Blows the Field Away” was the headline on an exclusive Drudge story claiming she had raised $36 million. Only later, with much less fanfare, did it become clear that only $19 million would count toward the Democratic primary. The Clinton campaign has also used Drudge to go on offense. In one example, an aide confirmed that the campaign sent Drudge a link to a story in which Michelle Obama seemed to take a swipe at Hillary Clinton over Bill’s infidelity. The story was presented—from Clinton to Drudge to the public—in a manner that was badly out of context, with a link to an exclusive videotape of Michelle Obama’s comment. But it nevertheless dominated the news cycle for 24 hours.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/the-crying-game\">Jan. 30, 2008</a>, The New Republic</strong>: \"The press is obsessed with Hillary's inner life. And much of Hillary's coverage does have a sexist bent. Her flashes of angry and teary frustration were thus ready-made for the msnbc-Drudge-YouTube complex. And it was their endless repetition and deconstruction that apparently did what all of Mark Penn's microtargeting and sloganeering could not: convince voters - -especially women -- that Hillary is, as the candidate herself put it in one interview, 'a real person.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://gawker.com/352972/the-dangerous-nut-vote-where-hillary-stands\">Feb. 5, 2008</a>, Gawker</strong>: \"Hill's relationship with ORIGINAL BLOGGER Matt Drudge is even weirder, if that's possible to imagine. Because Drudge needs her. He feeds off of her. Her hideously MSPainted pixilated weepy eye sat at the top of his page <i>all day.</i> He updates when she <i>coughs during an interview.</i> And he seems sadly uninspired by every other candidate in the race. Whether or not Hill's campaign has a special Drudge envoy, they needn't ever worry that he'll ignore them.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://gawker.com/353125/matt-drudge-just-wants-you-to-know-hillary-clinton-coughed-again\">Feb. 6, 2008</a></strong>,<strong> Gawker</strong>: \"The only two videos on Matt Drudge's YouTube account both feature Hillary Clinton having a coughing fit. Weird thing is, he used his account once last May to show her coughing at a commencement speech, then again today to show her hacking it up on TV. While the old video has actual footage, the new one is just a camcorder pointed at the TV, which would be dclass even when copying last night's Family Guy. Both videos are below, if you share Drudge's Clinton-cough fetish.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Feb. 15, 2008, Politico</strong>: Drudge 'seems obsessed with making Hillary Clinton our next president,' the magazine observed. Some in Clinton's circle date the change in the tone of the Drudge Report to Oct. 22, when The New York Times published its own front-page look at the campaign's courtship of the website. The piece further elevated Drudge's stature. It also turned his professed affection for Clinton into conventional wisdom. The Drudge Report soon shattered that conventional wisdom. On Nov. 25, Drudge floated the rumor she was having a lesbian affair with an aide over the teasing headline, 'Don't Go There.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://gawker.com/5008078/hillary-is-done-say-media-overlords\">May 7, 2008</a>, Gawker</strong>: \"Hey, look, Matt Drudge did something nice for the entire country: He ended the Democratic primary, even though it was supposed to continue until eternity. See the picture and headline at left, which ran atop <em>Drudge Report</em> tonight.

'I think he is fatigued by Clinton, I think he is invigorated by Obama,' said one person who knows Drudge. 'He would say that the Obama story is new. If you’re somebody who does what he does, you get really sick of the same stories.'\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/underground-man\">May 6, 2009</a>, The New Republic</strong>: \"On the morning of June 7, 2008, Matt Drudge showed up at the National Building Museum in Washington, where Hillary Clinton was scheduled to give her concession speech. At the entrance, Drudge found his host, Tracy Sefl, a Clinton campaign staffer who, the day before, had offered to meet Drudge at the event. Throughout the campaign, Sefl had served as the Clintons' preferred back channel to communicate with the mercurial operator of the Drudge Report. Both sides benefited from the arrangement: The Clinton camp could push favorable items into the news cycle, and Drudge would receive the inevitable traffic boost that accompanied anything Hillary-related.\"</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2500/2235\">July 6, 2009</a>, First Monday</strong>: \"The top 10 words of all time on the <em>Drudge Report</em> consist, as expected, primarily of grammatical structure words such as prepositions and articles. The only two nouns in the list are 'bush' for President Bush and 'us' for U.S. (United States), showing the strong focus on presidential issues in the <em>Drudge Report</em> during this period. (Drudge changes the capitalization of his words for emphasis, so all words are converted to lowercase for analysis.) After 'US', Iraq is the next most popular name, at #14 (2.8 percent), followed by Obama at #22 (2.07 percent), and Clinton at #32 (1.44 percent).

"content": "<p>There's no shortage of Republicans looking to unseat senators in primaries this year. But quantity is outpacing quality so far.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 616px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full \" alt=\"Kentucky candidate Matt Bevin (R).

(Mike Lawrence/The Gleaner via AP )</p></div>\n<p>Six of the 12 Republican senators running for reelection face primary challengers. But most of the contenders have yet to make serious inroads against the incumbents they are trying to knock off. Some have raised scant campaign cash. Others have been dogged by questions about their past. And none have built the groundswell of support necessary to do something as difficult knocking off a sitting senator before the general election.</p>\n<p>It's early in the cycle, but as it stands now, the field of challengers is wider than it is deep.</p>\n<p>The highest-profile race is in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell faces businessman Matt Bevin. McConnell's not a popular figure in Kentucky, but Bevin has yet to seize on his image problems to narrow the gap. He raised less than half the money McConnell brought in during the final three months of last year and polls show him lagging behind badly. Meanwhile, Bevin's own record has come under scrutiny. He's railed against the TARP program, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/02/matt-bevin-tarp-kentucky-senate-race-2014-103351.html\">yet he backed it</a> as an investment fund president in 2008. Bevin has about three months until the election to reverse the tide.</p>\n<p>Challengers to Sens. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) have fizzled. Graham's challengers <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/02/04/why-pretenders-outnumber-contenders-primarying-gop-senators/\">lag behind him badly</a> in the money chase and Alexander's main opponent trails him by a wide margin according to a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/11/alexander-poll-shows-him-up-big-in-gop-primary/\">recent poll</a> conducted for the senator's campaign. In Texas, Rep. Steve Stockman has been more distracting story than a serious opponent to Sen. John Cornyn.</p>\n<p>It's not easy to dislodge sitting senators in primaries. It's only happened eight times in the past 30 years, according to <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/long-odds-for-most-senate-primary-challenges/\">a tally</a> from the University of Virginia's Center for Politics.</p>\n<p>But half those instances came during the past two election cycles, amid the rise of the tea party. Some senators like Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) in 2012 and Robert Bennett (R-Utah) in 2010 were unprepared for the onslaught and backlash, and lost as a result. GOP Strategists say that the current crop of senators facing reelection learned from those mistakes, preparing early by raising money and reaching out to conservative activists and groups.</p>\n<p>In Texas, Cornyn <a href=\"http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/07/sen-john-cornyn-hires-tea-party-star-brendan-steinhauser-as-campaign-manager.html/\">recruited a tea party organizer</a> to manage his campaign. McConnell enlisted the support of Sen. Rand Paul, his junior colleague and a tea party rock star, early in his effort.</p>\n<p>\"Almost without exception Senators heeded the lessons from the last two cycles and have taken nothing for granted. They built solid campaign war chests, assembled top-flight campaign teams, and are criss-crossing their states,\" said Brian Walsh, a former National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman.</p>\n<p>The challenger who appears to have the best chance right now is Chris McDaniel, a Mississippi state senator running against Sen. Thad Cochran. McDaniel has won the support of the Club For Growth and the Senate Conservatives Fund, and he's proven that he can raise money. Cochran was rated the 34th most conservative senator in 2013, according to <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/2013-vote-ratings\">National Journal's vote ratings</a>, making him one of the more moderate members of the GOP Conference.</p>\n<p>McDaniel said technological advances have allowed challengers to compete more heavily with long-established incumbents.</p>\n<p>\"People are beginning to peer behind the veil for the first time in an awful long time,\" said McDaniel. \"They're scared and their anxious, so they've begun to focus on these votes. And they have the ability now to do it with the Internet and social media, whereas 10 years ago, many people didn't have that opportunity.\"</p>\n<p>But McDaniel he appears the be the exception to the rule this cycle. And even as he's impressed conservative activists early, he far from a shoo-in to win.</p>\n<p>Conservative strategists and candidates openly acknowledge the challenge they face this cycle. But they say they are not displeased with the landscape.</p>\n<p>\"Every challenger starts out as a long shot, so it's actually pretty remarkable that so many of them are competitive this year. If you told me a year ago that Mitch McConnell, Thad Cochran and Pat Roberts would all be fighting for their political lives today, I would not have believed it,\" said Senate Conservatives Fund executive director Matt Hoskins.</p>\n<p>It tends to take missteps from the incumbent to open the door for a challenger. Lugar, for example, badly bungled questions about his residency. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kan.) could fall victim to the same kind of scenario this year, if he doesn't put similar questions behind him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/08/us/senator-races-to-show-ties-including-an-address-in-kansas.html\">The New York Times reported last week</a> that Roberts rents out the home he owns in Kansas and is registered to vote at the address of supporters whom he pays rent to stay with when he is in town. Roberts's opponent Milton Wolf, a doctor and second cousin once removed to President Obama, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B-Cx-Uj5Qs&amp;feature=youtu.be\">released a radio ad</a> slamming Roberts on the matter Wednesday.</p>\n<p>It's far too early in the cycle to declare these races sealed up for the incumbents. Richard Mourdock, for example, trailed Lugar for much of the race in 2012 before closing in down the stretch.</p>\n<p>But the Republican senators are in decent shape, especially considering as conservative challengers have been flooding the zone.</p>\n<div id=\"slug_inline_bb\" class=\"borB1S borT1S marB26 padB10 padT10\">\n\t<div id=\"wpni_adi_inline_bb\" class=\"col300 centered\">\n\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\tplaceAd2( commercialNode, 'inline_bb', 'adi', '' );\n\t\t</script>\n\t </div>\n</div>\n",

Photographer: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg</p></div>\n<p>A formal effort to replace Boehner is now underway, launched by the Senate Conservatives Fund. The group is keeping an<a href=\"http://www.replacethespeaker.com/#whiplist\"> online whip list of which members stand where on replacing Boehner</a> and has plans to pressure conservative lawmakers to come out for or against him long before the November elections. Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador has said that<a href=\"http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/tea-party-raul-labrador-predicts-speaker-boehner-lose-gavel/\"> if Boehner tries to pass immigration reform, \"it should cost him his speakership.\"</a></p>\n<p>And, there are plenty of Boehner allies who wonder privately why he would want a job leading a conference that doesn't want to be led -- and who see signs that he is planning his exit strategy.</p>\n<p>\"Several of John's best friends are leaving Congress,\" said one high-level Republican well-versed in Republican House politics, noting that Sens. Saxby Chambliss (Ga.), Tom Coburn (Okla.) and Rep. Tom Latham (Iowa) are all retiring while Rep. Mike Simpson (Idaho) faces a serious primary challenge.  \"Senior staff has already departed. He attacked conservative groups -- rightly so. And he is looking for plenty of sunshine heading his way.\"</p>\n<p>Boehner, publicly, has been unequivocal about his future plans. He has filed for reelection to his Ohio House seat and looks like a lock to win this November. In the summer of 2012, he told Bloomberg: \"<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/06/05/john-boehner-is-the-linchpin-to-immigration-and-the-debt-ceiling-heres-why/\">Every two years is a decision about just what you want to do, but I fully expect to remain speaker</a>.\"</p>\n<p>Boehner insiders insist that nothing that has happened over the past six months has changed his mind on that front. And, while they acknowledge he has taken considerable heat from outside conservative groups about how he handled the debt-ceiling increase, they insist the move was actually relatively well-received by his GOP members -- including the likes of hard-line tea party types like Labrador and Rep. Justin Amash (Mich.), both of whom advocated for a clean debt-limit increase.</p>\n<p>And, by keeping the GOP away from a high-profile showdown with the White House over the debt ceiling, Boehner allies argue, he has preserved the likelihood that the 2014 midterms will be fought on territory (President Obama and Obamacare) that should lead to Republican gains in both the House and Senate.</p>\n<p>\"While there is political carping going on in the halls of Congress and press releases going back home after last night's vote, it would be a mistake for Boehner critics and speaker wannabes to believe he is headed for the exits or driven from the rostrum,\" said former New York Rep. Tom Reynolds. \"Boehner is still the speaker, and everyone knows it is an impossible job.\"</p>\n<p>There is no question that elections have the ability to change narratives -- and career arcs -- overnight. Literally. And, it's also true that if Boehner is credited as the guy who helped Republicans keep or even expand their majority in the House, the case to be made for getting rid of him may well lose some steam or stall out completely. (Winning  in politics, like in sports, solves lots of problems.)</p>\n<p>But, it's important to remember just how close Boehner came to being pushed to a second ballot -- and a likely defeat -- in the vote for speaker at the start of the 113th Congress. <a href=\" http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/boehner-reelected-as-house-speaker/2013/01/03/c60b0970-55cb-11e2-8b9e-dd8773594efc_story.html\">He came within six votes of that fate </a>when 12 Republicans voted for someone other than him as speaker, the closest any speaker has come to being pushed to a second ballot since Newt Gingrich in January 1997. That's a very small margin for error come 2015.</p>\n<p>There is also the possibility that, despite what he says at the moment, Boehner ultimately won't even seek the speakership again. The political realities of his job are such that it would be impossible (and colossally stupid) for him to announce his future plans until the moment he is actually leaving. If Boehner made clear to his colleagues that he planned to leave the speakership after the 2014 elections, he would immediately become a lame duck, with every ambitious House Republican plotting his or her campaign to replace the Ohio Republican. He is saying he plans to be speaker in the 114th Congress because there is simply nothing else he can say and preserve his ability to lead the GOP conference between now and the election.</p>\n<p>Given all of that, we continue to believe it is entirely plausible that Boehner wins reelection, Republicans hold the House, and he announces some time in late November or early December that he is stepping down from the speakership and leaving the House. It's also entirely plausible that Boehner stays on as speaker (or at least runs for speaker in the 113th Congress. Or that he simply hasn't made up his mind yet and won't until after the November election.</p>\n<p>The question undergirding all of this is how Boehner wants to end his congressional career. Does he want to go out on his own terms or stare down his enemies and risk the possibility of being forced out?</p>\n",

"title": "How &#8216;Red Sox vs. Yankees&#8217; explains Connecticut politics",
"content": "<p>The fundamental question of my childhood growing up in Connecticut was this one: Red Sox or Yankees?</p>\n<p>My dad -- a native of New Britain, Conn. -- was firmly on the Yankees side of things. My mom was ostensibly a Yankee fan but didn't care all that much. My best friends (they were twins) -- and, especially, their mom -- were big-time Red Sox fans. Which side you fell on mattered, and was viewed as a sign of who you were. Yankee fans were New Yorkers -- gritty, gruff, tough. Red Sox fans were New Englanders -- flinty, gruff, tough.  (In retrospect, there was less of a difference between the two than I thought as a kid.)</p>\n<p>Now, finally, I have a scientific explanation of the great divide in Connecticut. It comes courtesy of <a href=\"http://harvardsportsanalysis.wordpress.com/2012/08/17/finding-the-true-border-between-yankee-and-red-sox-nation-using-facebook-data/\">Ben Blatt of the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective</a> who, using Facebook likes, went town-by-town to map the Nutmeg State's rooting interests. Here's Blatt's explanation of his methodology:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To figure out where the true boundaries are I used Facebook’s ‘Create and Ad’ feature. By pretending be buying an advertisement, Facebook will tell you the approximate number of people in an area who ‘like’ something. For instance there are 101,400 people in Boston who like the Red Sox (of which, 280 are also 18-year old males who also ‘like’ Justin Bieber).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here's Blatt's town-by-town breakdown of fandom:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80470\" style=\"width: 636px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-80470\" alt=\"Image courtesy of Ben Blatt\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-3.55.04-PM.png\" width=\"626\" height=\"306\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of Ben Blatt</p></div>\n<p>And here's his more definitive attempt to draw a Major League Baseball Mason-Dixon line in Connecticut.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_80471\" style=\"width: 591px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-80471\" alt=\"Image courtesy of Ben Blatt\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2014/02/Screen-Shot-2014-02-11-at-3.55.10-PM.png\" width=\"581\" height=\"408\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image courtesy of Ben Blatt</p></div>\n<p>This second map explains my childhood perfectly. See Glastonbury, the town in central Connecticut that is right along the Yankees-Red Sox line?  That's the town next to Marlborough, where I grew up.</p>\n<p>There's also some politics -- of course -- involved in this Red Sox-Yankees split.  The Yankees territory generally follows the boundaries of the 4th and 5th congressional districts, which have, traditionally, been the most likely to send Republicans to Congress. (Rep. Chris Shays represented the 4th, while Rep. Nancy Johnson held the 5th. Both districts are now held by Democrats.) The eastern part of the state, on the other hand, has long been more friendly territory for Democrats -- reflecting its similarities to New England and especially neighboring Massachusetts.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-80539\" alt=\"congressional\" src=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/files/2014/02/congressional-1024x797.gif\" width=\"1024\" height=\"797\" /></p>\n<p>So, if you want to understand the politics of Connecticut, you really need to understand the geography of  Red Sox-Yankees fandom in the state. In a strange sort of way, that makes perfect sense.</p>\n<div id=\"slug_inline_bb\" class=\"borB1S borT1S marB26 padB10 padT10\">\n\t<div id=\"wpni_adi_inline_bb\" class=\"col300 centered\">\n\t\t<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\t\tplaceAd2( commercialNode, 'inline_bb', 'adi', '' );\n\t\t</script>\n\t </div>\n</div>\n",

(Melina Mara/The Washington Post)</p></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mary-landrieu-d-la/gIQAi61x9O_topic.html\">Sen. Mary Landrieu</a> (D-La.) will bring a sharply different outlook to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee now that she has taken the gavel from Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who has moved over to chair the Senate Finance Committee.</p>\n<p>Landrieu <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/keystone-supporters-opponents-increase-pressure-on-obama-ahead-of-2014-elections/2014/02/04/f64aa388-8da7-11e3-95dd-36ff657a4dae_story.html\">favors building the Keystone XL pipeline</a>, protecting tax breaks or incentives for oil drilling, and placing limits on the power of federal agencies to set mercury or carbon dioxide guidelines for coal-fired power plants. Wyden takes the opposite position on all those issues.</p>\n<p>Landrieu supports giving oil companies the right to export crude oil as well as natural gas, while Wyden, who before becoming chairman introduced a bill to block natural gas exports, does not have a public position on crude oil exports.</p>\n<p>The Louisiana Democrat helps maintain the Democrats’ majority in the Senate, but she is closer to the oil and gas industry than most other members of her party.</p>\n<p>Does any of this matter in a Congress hard-pressed to pass any legislation? Maybe. Landrieu could try to obstruct some <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/02/06/coal-ash-is-spilling-into-north-carolinas-river-heres-why-its-so-hard-to-regulate/\">Obama administration initiatives</a>, especially on coal plants. She could work with committee Republicans to fashion legislation closer to the oil and gas industry interests. And she can make her voice heard more clearly than ever.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, the Energy Department Tuesday gave conditional approval to another liquefied natural gas project, this one in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, and owned by San Diego-based Sempra Energy. It would export 1.7 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas. Just one day earlier, on Monday, Landrieu, who already had a lock on the new chairmanship, sent a sharply worded <a href=\"http://www.landrieu.senate.gov/files/documents/2014_02_10_letter_to_moniz_re_sempra.pdf\">letter</a> to Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz saying that the delay in issuing a permit was “simply unacceptable” and that “we must not sit on our hands and let this great opportunity go by.”</p>\n<p>Many environmental groups oppose exports of natural gas because they believe the exports will spur demand for more fracking. And many big industrial users of natural gas oppose exports because it would raise prices, though the Energy Department says only slightly.</p>\n<p>“Senator Landrieu’s chairmanship arrives at a critical moment for U.S. energy policy,” American Petroleum Institute president Jack Gerard said in a statement. “With her strong support, the people of Louisiana have played a major role in America’s energy revolution, and her deep understanding of energy issues will continue to serve her well as chairman. We look forward to working with Sen. Landrieu on smart policies that will strengthen American energy security.”</p>\n<p>Landrieu also wants to increase the portion of federal royalties that goes to states along the Gulf of Mexico coast, a crusade of hers for years. As it stands, all states get oil and gas royalties in water up to three miles from shore, but the federal government owns the waters beyond that point. She already led the successful fight in 2006 to get 37.5 percent of federal royalties on certain leases off the gulf states directed to those state governments and coastal restoration programs.</p>\n<p>But in a compromise, the legislation imposed an annual <a href=\"http://www.boem.gov/Oil-and-Gas-Energy-Program/Energy-Economics/Revenue-Sharing/Index.aspx \">$500 million cap on payment</a>s to the Gulf Coast producing states.</p>\n<p>Landrieu, whose state consistently ranks at or near the bottom of social welfare benefits has now introduced a bill that would lift the cap and shift revenue from the Treasury Department to the states of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama. Her bill would also let inland states keep 50 percent of the royalty and rental payments on renewable energy produced on federal lands, according to an Oct. 17 press release.</p>\n<p>Landrieu has also hammered away on the Keystone XL project. On Feb. 7, after the State Department issued a final environmental impact statement, Landrieu urged people to sign a petition urging President Obama to approve the Keystone XL pipeline.</p>\n<p>“This new study underscores what has been said all along about Keystone XL Pipeline:  it’s time to build,” she wrote. “I urge the president to act swiftly and give final approval so we can put people to work in these good-paying jobs right away and our refineries in Louisiana and Texas can refine this energy from our close ally, Canada. It’s time for the president to take action.”</p>\n<p>Daniel J. Weiss, director of climate policy at the liberal-leaning Center for American Progress, said “Many people expect Chairwoman Landrieu to increase the Committee’s focus on the oil and gas industry, particularly on royalty payments to states from offshore production.  At the same time, there may be less attention paid to policies that grow investments in clean alternative transportation fuels and renewable electricity.\"</p>\n<p>And as she faces reelection this fall, her energy positions are likely to come under fire from both liberals and conservatives.

Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) bill to <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=112&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00063\">eliminate $2.4 billion in tax breaks</a> for the big five oil companies; Wyden voted for it.</p>\n<p>In 2010, Landrieu voted to <a href=\"http://scorecard.lcv.org/roll-call-vote/2010-184-dirty-air-act-2x-score\">block the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability</a> to set limits on the emissions of carbon dioxide, a common greenhouse gas.
